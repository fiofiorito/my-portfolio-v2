At that time I had just finished the Udemy Full-Stack bootcamp I did and with little React knowledge I gave it a shot! To be honest, this project made me sign up for the React course from Coderhouse, while coding this project there were so many things I barely understood, however that did not stop me ðŸ˜‰",

It is a to-do list that I made using EJS (Embedded JavaScript), which is a templating language, meaning you can reuse code by creating templates. This project has a database with 2 collections, one for tasks and one for the different lists that can be created. That way everyone can use its own list and have its own tasks!",
